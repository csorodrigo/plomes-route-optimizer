# PDF Export Formatting Fixes - PLOMES-ROTA-CEP

## Overview
Fixed multiple formatting issues in the PDF export functionality that were causing visual problems and missing data in route reports.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Logo Deformation ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** The CIA Máquinas logo was appearing distorted/deformed in the PDF export due to fixed dimensions that didn't preserve aspect ratio.

**Solution:**
- Replaced fixed `logoWidth` and `logoHeight` with `logoMaxWidth` and `logoMaxHeight`
- Created `loadImageWithDimensions()` function to get actual image dimensions
- Implemented proper aspect ratio calculation
- Dynamic positioning of company text based on actual logo size

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Fixed dimensions
logoWidth: 50,
logoHeight: 25,

// After: Max dimensions with aspect ratio preservation
logoMaxWidth: 40,
logoMaxHeight: 40,
```

### 2. Statistics Section Formatting ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Statistics boxes had poor spacing, layout issues, and unprofessional appearance.

**Solution:**
- Redesigned statistics boxes with modern card-style layout
- Added colored top borders for visual distinction
- Improved spacing calculations
- Center-aligned text within boxes
- Increased box height for better readability

**Visual Improvements:**
- Green border for "Distância Total"
- Orange border for "Tempo Estimado"
- Blue border for "Total de Paradas"
- Better background color (#f8f9fa)
- Improved typography and spacing

### 3. Table Formatting ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Customer table had poor alignment, inconsistent spacing, and unprofessional appearance.

**Solution:**
- Adjusted column widths for better content distribution: `[12, 55, 65, 38, 20]`
- Increased header and row heights for better readability
- Center-aligned headers and numeric columns
- Improved border styling with consistent colors
- Better alternate row coloring
- Added table header repetition on new pages

### 4. Missing Customer Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Some selected customers were not appearing in the PDF export.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced customer matching logic with multiple fallback strategies:
  1. Primary: Match by `waypoint.id`
  2. Fallback 1: Match by `waypoint.customer_id`
  3. Fallback 2: Match by `waypoint.customerId`
  4. Fallback 3: Name-based matching (case-insensitive)
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Handle both `street_address` and `address` properties

### 5. Overall Layout and Spacing ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Poor spacing throughout the document, unprofessional appearance.

**Solution:**
- Increased header separator line thickness
- Better margin calculations
- Improved section spacing
- Added proper pagination with header repetition
- Enhanced color scheme with consistent border colors

## Technical Improvements

### New Helper Functions
```javascript
// Load image with dimensions for aspect ratio calculation
async loadImageWithDimensions(src)

// Convert hex colors to RGB for jsPDF
hexToRgb(hex)

// Enhanced customer matching
getCustomersInRouteOrder(route, customers)
```

### Configuration Updates
```javascript
// New configuration with better defaults
this.config = {
  logoMaxWidth: 40,
  logoMaxHeight: 40,
  colors: {
    primary: '#1976d2',
    secondary: '#666',
    accent: '#4caf50',
    text: '#333',
    light: '#f5f5f5',
    border: '#e0e0e0'  // New border color
  }
}
```
