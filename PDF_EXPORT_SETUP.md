```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"PDF libraries not found" error**
   - Run `npm install` in the frontend directory
   - Verify `jspdf` and `html2canvas` are in `node_modules`

2. **Logo not appearing in PDF**
   - Verify `/frontend/public/logo.png` exists
   - Check browser console for image loading errors

3. **Export button disabled**
